## Installation Steps

Before you begin, ensure you have the following environment set up:

*   **Node.js v18+**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
*   **MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is running locally. Follow the [MongoDB Installation Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) for your operating system.
*   **Git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
*   **(Optional) Ionic CLI**: `npm install -g @ionic/cli`

Once your environment is set up, follow these steps:

1.  **Configure Metamask Wallet**: create a connection on the `contracts/.env` file within the project directory. Add your Metamask wallet private key and a URL for the Metamask API development key.

    Example `contracts/.env`:
    ```
    PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
    SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your_key
    ```

2.  **Configure server database**: create a connection on the `server/.env` file within the project directory. Add your mongoDB connection link and port into the file.

    Example `server/.env`:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
    PORT=5000
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal and run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in the following directories:
    *   `client/`
    *   `server/`
    *   The root of the project (`./`)

## Execution Steps

To run the project, ensure MongoDB is running with the correct connection link configured in your `server/.env` file. Then, from the root directory of the project, execute:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start both the client and server applications.
